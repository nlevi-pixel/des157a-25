            <h3>Form Design Principles</h3>
            <p> When beginning to practice designing forms, it is important to revert back to basic design principles while adhering to current UX/UI patterns. For instance, a core design principle is to create contrast, similarly present web design patterns require contrast for usability and accessibility. Designing forms is uniquely important, as it can easily allow for many user mistakes or quickly lose engagement. As mentioned in the article, <a href=https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f>Best Practices for Form Design</a>, there are several practices that designers should follow to refrain from these issues. </p>
     

        
            <p>With the digitization of society, it is normal for people to fill out important documentation online, which usually requires users to set aside a lengthy amount of time. In my personal experience, I found three particular practices that need to be universally followed but are still rare in many websites. Them being:</p>

            <br>

            <ol>
                <li><div class="strong">Multiple Steps:</div> this is where a website requires a lengthy amount of field inputs and divides it up by “steps”. In which the user is provided with a progress visual of how much of the document has been completed and how much is left. I find it would be even more helpful to let the user know the approximate amount of time the form takes to fill.</li>

                <br>

                <li><div class="strong">Form Feedback:</div>across many websites, if a certain field is completed incorrectly, it’s common for the website to provide an error feedback message without specifying where the error occurred. This makes many users lose patience, which can be easily avoided.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>CodeLab Application Form</h3>

        <p>For the job application form of CodeLab, a UC Davis organization, they designed it in an elegant and easily-read format. The interface is sleek, required fields are marked, and feedback is given in the fields that still need to be filled. </p>

        <h3>Overlay Considerations for Users</h3>

        

        <p>In the article <a href = "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>, the author discusses the common pitfalls of the excessive use of lightboxes that have abundantly appeared in web design recently. Although overlays can be an effective tool for web designers to display important information that can be overlooked, it can easily lead to user frustration and decrease website performance. To avoid misuse of overlays, the author recommends to provide clear exit options, ensure visual distinction, and conduct proper user testing. </p>
        
        <p>Similarly, in the article <a href = "https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>, the author provides more guidelines on how to create overlays that are efficient and empathetic. This is through the use of appropriate modal sizing and placement, user-initiated activation, responsive consideration for mobile screens, and keyboard accessible.
