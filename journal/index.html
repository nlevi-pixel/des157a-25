            <h3>Form Design Principles</h3>
            <p> When beginning to practice designing forms, it is important to revert back to basic design principles while adhering to current UX/UI patterns. For instance, a core design principle is to create contrast, similarly present web design patterns require contrast for usability and accessibility. Designing forms is uniquely important, as it can easily allow for many user mistakes or quickly lose engagement. As mentioned in the article, <a href=https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f>Best Practices for Form Design</a>, there are several practices that designers should follow to refrain from these issues. </p>
     

        
            <p>With the digitization of society, it is normal for people to fill out important documentation online, which usually requires users to set aside a lengthy amount of time. In my personal experience, I found three particular practices that need to be universally followed but are still rare in many websites. Them being:</p>

            <br>

            <ol>
                <li><div class="strong">Multiple Steps:</div> this is where a website requires a lengthy amount of field inputs and divides it up by “steps”. In which the user is provided with a progress visual of how much of the document has been completed and how much is left. I find it would be even more helpful to let the user know the approximate amount of time the form takes to fill.</li>

                <br>

                <li><div class="strong">Form Feedback:</div>across many websites, if a certain field is completed incorrectly, it’s common for the website to provide an error feedback message without specifying where the error occurred. This makes many users lose patience, which can be easily avoided.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>CodeLab Application Form</h3>

        <p>For the job application form of CodeLab, a UC Davis organization, they designed it in an elegant and easily-read format. The interface is sleek, required fields are marked, and feedback is given in the fields that still need to be filled. </p>

        <h3>Overlay Considerations for Users</h3>

        

        <p>In the article <a href = "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>, the author discusses the common pitfalls of the excessive use of lightboxes that have abundantly appeared in web design recently. Although overlays can be an effective tool for web designers to display important information that can be overlooked, it can easily lead to user frustration and decrease website performance. To avoid misuse of overlays, the author recommends to provide clear exit options, ensure visual distinction, and conduct proper user testing. </p>
        
        <p>Similarly, in the article <a href = "https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>, the author provides more guidelines on how to create overlays that are efficient and empathetic. This is through the use of appropriate modal sizing and placement, user-initiated activation, responsive consideration for mobile screens, and keyboard accessible.

        <h3>Interactivty as a Product of Visual Thinking</h3>
        <p>
        I’ve seen a consistent rise in recent years of the magic of website image interaction as a method of attracting and intriguing users. With younger generations depending on visual representations and imagery to maintain engagement, it’s no surprise that this rise is occurring. The article, <a href= "https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>, thoroughly explains how children retain information successfully through intriguing photographs. 
        While I thoroughly enjoy this sudden burst of creative interactivity and agree with the advantages of an intriguing image, it does come with some costs. The largest cost being unintentional loading issues. While interactivity is a signal of uniqueness, it still has remnants of early websites with loading issues. The combination of type in motion and images creates a sensational effect on the eyes that also can open the flood gates of cognitive overload and lose engagement. So, while this trending innovation significantly increases the visual aesthetic, it's also important to remember that there still needs to be a stronger sense of accessibility and functionality.

        One incredible website by, <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/where-giants-roam">Where Giants Roam</a>, showcases a beautiful synergy between interactivity, type, and images. With each scroll, a user is invited by different captivating images and VFX, allowing them to first be exposed to the product and choose whether to continue exploring. This shows a precise connection to the article’s theory of intriguing photographs as a gateway to knowledge and visual thinking.</p>

        <h3>Visual Thinking Concepts</h3>
        <div class="">
            <img src="images/tate-image.jpg" alt="tate image" width="400px">

        </div>
        
        <p>In this image from my peer, he is exhibiting images from his surrounding environment which inspires his typographic knowledge and exploration. I’m not quite sure what this infrastructure feature is called, but there is a distinct intentional and consequential typography that makes the image intriguing. I find that particular aspect of it the most interesting, there is a sort of mystery along with it. Making the viewer focus on the type made from welding metal, creating a juxtaposition with the structural patterns of the feature. To make his project more conceptual, I think it’d be a great idea to create graphics that align with the figures of the photographs. This could create a deeper story for his unique perspective of the elements he sees in each photograph.</p>

        <p>This is an image of mine that I took during my years as a student living in Isla Vista, a small town that was home to students at UCSB and SBCC. For my project I plan to capture the story of miscellaneous vintage objects that I encounter. The concept will be following how past objects that once were of great value are hidden between items that society has come to value now. The image above is an example of an object (rather large one) that stopped me in my tracks in wonder and admiration of an era of time where style was deemed more authentic. This is a topic that I consider in a lot of my design work and surrounding materialistic objects. It captures the consideration I take and am sure others do, of how our society has progressed away from individualism in design into a consumerist culture that has embraced uniformity. </p>
