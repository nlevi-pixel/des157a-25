            <h3>Form Design Principles</h3>
            <p> When beginning to practice designing forms, it is important to revert back to basic design principles while adhering to current UX/UI patterns. For instance, a core design principle is to create contrast, similarly present web design patterns require contrast for usability and accessibility. Designing forms is uniquely important, as it can easily allow for many user mistakes or quickly lose engagement. As mentioned in the article, <a href=https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f>Best Practices for Form Design</a>, there are several practices that designers should follow to refrain from these issues. </p>
     

        
            <p>With the digitization of society, it is normal for people to fill out important documentation online, which usually requires users to set aside a lengthy amount of time. In my personal experience, I found three particular practices that need to be universally followed but are still rare in many websites. Them being:</p>

            <br>

            <ol>
                <li><div class="strong">Multiple Steps:</div> this is where a website requires a lengthy amount of field inputs and divides it up by “steps”. In which the user is provided with a progress visual of how much of the document has been completed and how much is left. I find it would be even more helpful to let the user know the approximate amount of time the form takes to fill.</li>

                <br>

                <li><div class="strong">Form Feedback:</div>across many websites, if a certain field is completed incorrectly, it’s common for the website to provide an error feedback message without specifying where the error occurred. This makes many users lose patience, which can be easily avoided.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>CodeLab Application Form</h3>

        <p>For the job application form of CodeLab, a UC Davis organization, they designed it in an elegant and easily-read format. The interface is sleek, required fields are marked, and feedback is given in the fields that still need to be filled. </p>
